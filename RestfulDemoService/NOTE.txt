Services are implemented.

mvn install is working. 
Additionally you can run service by using spring-boot:run command. This will run in memory tomcat instance and services become available on localhost:8080

In test package ba.enox.codesample.restfuldemo.api you can find:
	TransactionControllerTest which test basic functionalities
	ThreadExecutionTest with simple thread execution and calculation check
	Restxxx two soap ui projects for manual execution.
